                <li><p>This all started oddly in the Biden server. Biden created a contest for whoever makes the best emotes keeps the event server (not main biden server).
                    Dr. Fries being the amazing awesome hot guy that he his made a bunch of good emotes for biden. He created a pact with another emote maker named Maya.
                    With the combined power of Dr. Fries and Maya they made the coolest, bestest emotes and won the contest.</p></li>
                <li><p>They debated for weeks figuring out what they wanted the server to become. They had one goal in common, make the best one image server. Maya suggested to make a competitor for the Burger server. Fries has been founded.</p></li>
                <li><p>Fries had a boost, starting with around 150 members. This made it possible to start partnerships immediately. We wanted to take over Burger in members. 
                    Mr. Burger joined fries, this was an intense moment. Dr. Fries and Mr. Burger started talking business, as you do.
                    They decided to not declare war, but declare peace. They created a partnership that still holds strong to this day. </p></li>
